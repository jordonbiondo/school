* Trusted systems
** Bell LaPadula
- top secret -> unclassified public
- confidentiality
- contrast to biba which is about integrity
- no read up
- no write down
- no sec changes during operation
** Biba integrety
- prevent unauth mods
- maintain consistency
- no read down
- no write up
** reference model
- validate read and writes on os
- must be tamper proof and always on
- must be small
** TPM - trusted platform module
- secure key generation
- endorsement key
- sealing
- can be used on disks, passwords, platforms
** auth boot
- check sec on boot
- full disk encry
- extends bios firmware
* OS Sec
- configure to use max security
- only update programs that you know are bug proof 
- supervise program at higher level, non root -> root bad
* malware
** virus
attached to some program you got
** worm
spreads about writes it self around local/network
** trojan
pretends to be useful, actually malware
** polymorphic code
- same result, different code
- code changes, can't detect known bad pattern
- sandboxxing can block
** payload
- botnet
- backdoor
- rootkit
** detection
- virtualization
- sandbox
- hash scans ...
* DDOS
** what
- spam spam spam
- botnet
- echo requests smurf
- reflected, send request to other, reply to victim 
- dns amp, flood with dns response traffic - like reflect
** defense
- firewall rules to only allow needed traffic
- rate limiting switches, some routers have good defense
- app front end hardward, analyze packets, and ident them
- itrustion prevent system,
- dds, block conneciton based attacks
- reroute traffic to black hole 
* intrustion detection
- sig based: compare packets to known attach patterns as sigs
- anomoly based: look for out of ordanary traffic, ports etc 
- honey pots, fake computers set up to trap attacks
- ips: actually block intrusions, false positives
- ethics and stuff
  * Software Security
      + Buffer overflow attacks and defenses
      + Race conditions
      + Injection attacks
      + Format string vulnerabilities
      + Least privledge
  * Operating System security
      + Configuration
      + Program updates (should they always be done?)
      + Mediation between programs
      + Resource management
      + Logging
      + Least privldege as applied to system admin
      + VM security
