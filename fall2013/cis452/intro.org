* OS
** Chapter 1
*** Definition
    - Interface between user and machine
    - "An interrupt driven control program"
**** Goal:
     - Convenience for user
     - Control program
**** Purpose:
     - Efficient use of the system resources
     - Recourse Manager
*** System Model
    - CPU
    - System Bus
    - DMA: Direct Memory Access
*** Interrupts
    - Control transfers, hardware -> CPU
    - model
      | Main | -> | interrupt |    | resume |
      |------+----+-----------+----+--------|
      |      |    |           | -> |        |
**** Types:
***** Hardware 
      - Parity
***** Software 
      - Overflow
***** Trap|Exception 
      - Page Fault
**** Service
     1. Recognize
     2. Control Transfer
     3. Return state
*** Memory Hierarchy 
    | Type            | Storage | Speed |
    |-----------------+---------+-------|
    | registers       | Low     | High  |
    | cache           |         |       |
    | electronic disk |         |       |
    | magnetic disk   |         |       |
    | optical disk    |         |       |
    | magnetic tapes  | High    | Low   |
*** Protection
**** Time   
     - Time is a resource of the CPU
     - Timers implemented
     - A program can hog the system but not monopolize it.
**** Space (memory)
     - Create fences around blocks of memory
**** Dual Mode Operation
     - Root (admin) vs User : Privileged Instructions
     - A user doesn't control, the user makes requests and the OS fulexecuteem.
       | Userland | execute a process | sys call |                      | return to process |
       |----------+-------------------+----------+----------------------+-------------------|
       | System   |                   |          | execute the sys call |                   |
***** System call interface 
      A printf call goes out to the kernel for stdout writing
      1. User application makes requests to the interface
      2. Kernel executes sys calls
      3. Returns pointer and data to interface
      4. Returns information to user process

** Chapter 3
*** Processes
**** Definition
     - Program in execution
     - State
     - Independent, executing entity
     - user/kernal
**** Process State
     Can describe a characteristic of a process. (Fig 3.2)
