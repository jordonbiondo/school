*** Definition
    - Interface between user and machine
    - "An interrupt driven control program"
**** Goal:
     - Convenience for user
     - Control program
**** Purpose:
     - Efficient use of the system resources
     - Recourse Manager
*** System Model
    - CPU
    - System Bus
    - DMA: Direct Memory Access
*** Interrupts
    - Control transfers, hardware -> CPU
    - model
      | Main | -> | interrupt |    | resume |
      |------+----+-----------+----+--------|
      |      |    |           | -> |        |
**** Types:
***** Hardware 
      - Parity
***** Software 
      - Overflow
***** Trap|Exception 
      - Page Fault
**** Service
     1. Recognize
     2. Control Transfer
     3. Return state
*** Memory Hierarchy 
    | Type            | Storage | Speed  |
    |-----------------+---------+--------|
    | registers       | Low     | High   |
    | cache           |         |        |
    | electronic disk |         |        |
    | magnetic disk   |         |        |
    | optical disk    |         |        |
    | magnetic tapes  | High    | Low    |
*** Protection
**** Time   
     - Time is a resource of the CPU
     - Timers implemented
     - A program can hog the system but not monopolize it.
**** Space (memory)
     - Create fences around blocks of memory
**** Dual Mode Operation
     - Root (admin) vs User : Privileged Instructions
     - A user doesn't control, the user makes requests and the OS fulexecuteem.
       | Userland | execute a process | sys call |                      | return to process |
       |----------+-------------------+----------+----------------------+-------------------|
       | System   |                   |          | execute the sys call |                   |
***** System call interface 
      A printf call goes out to the kernel for stdout writing
      1. User application makes requests to the interface
      2. Kernel executes sys calls
      3. Returns pointer and data to interface
      4. Returns information to user process

**** Process Operations
***** Create
      - Spawn new process
      - Parent
      - fork() function
	creates exact copy of parent process in new address space
***** Execution
      - exec() function
	Many different versions of the function
	Replaces text (code) and data areas with the new programs text and data.
	Runs the process.
***** Blocking
      - Waiting for an event
	wait(): waits for event (child process to terminate)
***** Terminate
      - conclude executions, Recover resources
      - exit() : terminate and return to wait() in parent
**** Process Scheduling
     Purpose: Efficient, Higher throughput
***** Schedule example
****** Inefficient: linear
       8 total time units
      | cpu time |   1 |  2 |   3 |  4 |   5 |  6 |   7 |  8 |
      |----------+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----|
      | Process1 | cpu | io | cpu | io |     |    |     |    |
      |----------+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----+-----+----|
      | Process2 |     |    |     |    | cpu | io | cpu | io |

****** Efficient: scheduled
       5 total time units
      | cpu time |   1 | 2   | 3   | 4   |  5 | 6 | 7 | 8 |
      |----------+-----+-----+-----+-----+----+---+---+---|
      | Process1 | cpu | io  | cpu | io  |    |   |   |   |
      |----------+-----+-----+-----+-----+----+---+---+---|
      | Process2 |     | cpu | io  | cpu | io |   |   |   |
***** Context Switch
****** switch processes
       1. executing p0
       2. save state in pcb0
       3. reload state in pcb1
       4. execute p1
       5. save state into pcb1
       6. reload state in pcb0
       7. continue executing p1
****** Exchange Environment
****** Mechanism:
       | Type        | Description                    | Example |
       |-------------+--------------------------------+---------|
       | Interrupt   | external event                 | timer   |
       | System call | task voluntarily waits         | open()  |
       | Trap        | caused by current instructions | fault   |

**** Interprocess Communication (IPC)
***** Types
****** Shared Memory
       One process writes to a memory location and another one reads it
****** Message Passing
       Process sends message to the OS, OS handles sending it to the other process
***** Primitives
      - Read Write
      - Send Receive
***** Addressing:
****** Direct
       Communicating with a named entity
       ex: send(process1, message)
****** Indirect
       Communicating with a services
       ex: send(service, message)
***** Naming
****** Symmetric 
       - both
****** Asymmetric
       - one
       Send(p, message)
       Recv(* &message)
***** Timing
****** Synchronous
       Blocking: won't continue until message sent was received
****** Asynchronous
       Buffering: will continue after a send.
       Sending is generally done asynchronously, receiving generally blocking
       Likely sending to the OS
       
**** Shared Memory
     | Parent        | Child         |
     |---------------+---------------|
     | x = 3         |               |
     | fork()        |               |
     | print(x) -> 3 | print(x) -> 3 |
     | ...           | x = 5         |
     | ...           | exit()        |
     | print(x) -> 3 |               | 
***** Functions:
      | Function                                                | Idea   |
      |---------------------------------------------------------+--------|
      | [[elisp:(man "shmget")][int   shmget(key_t key, size_t size, int shmflg)]]        | Create |
      | [[elisp:(man "shmat")][void* shmat(int shmid, const void *shmaddr, int shmflg)]] | Attach |
      | [[elisp:(man "shmdt")][int   shmdt(const void *shmaddr)]]                        | Detach |
      | [[elisp:(man "shmctl")][int   shmctl(int shmid, int cmd, struct shmid_ds *buf)]]  | Remove |
***** Signals
      - Software Interrupt
      - Process Registers signal-handling function
	function to call when a signal is recieved (what to do)
      - Asynchronous
      - Predefined signals:
	1) SIGCHLD
	2) SIGINT "C-c"
	3) SIGUSR1
      - signal()
      - kill()
***** Pipes
      - Unidirectional, Synchronized communication
      - On a 4kb ram buffer that acts like a file
      - Parent -> Write ================ Read -> Child
	
	

      
*** Threads
    - Path of execution, a lightweight process
    - Unlike a process: 
      a unit or resource ownership (memory, files devices)
      A thread is a unit of work (execution)
    - A process may have multiple threads (paths of execution)
    - Scheduled by OS like a process
**** Game example      
***** A Single Threaded Process Game  
****** Text
******* Loop
******** Input
******** Compute
******** Display
****** Data: shared
***** A Multi Threaded Process Game
****** Text
******* Thread1: Input
       	Puts input in shared data space
******* Thread2: Compute
       	Reads input Data, writes world Data
******* Thread3: Display
       	Read world Data, displays graphics
****** Data: shared
******* Input Data
******* World Data
**** Process Vs Thread
***** Process
      - Address space
      - Globals
      - Files
      - Signals
      - Timers
      - Children
***** Thread
      - Program counter
      - Stack
      - Registers
      - State
      - Children
	A thread's children can stop reporting to parent thread and report elsewhere, becoming peers
**** Benefits of Threads
***** Performance
      - Faster to create because there is no new address space. 
	Create, destroy, and context switch are very easy.
      - Utilizes multiple cores like processes can.
      - Shared memory communication 
	(also a downside due to added developer controlled complexity).
***** Blocking
      - Threads time-share CPU
***** Overlap 
      - I/O <-> Computation
      - Example: excel computations cascading
***** Asynchronous Processing
      - Periodic Routine (auto backups)
***** Program Structure
      - Intuitive Design, especially with OOP
**** Thread Lifestyle
***** Create
      - Function
      - Arguments
***** Execution
      - Running (cpu)
      - Blocked (wait)
***** Termination
      - Return to parent thread
      - Detach
**** File Servers
***** Single Threaded
      - Search cache for file
      - if found, server
      - if not, block while retrieving from disk
***** Multi Threaded
      - has a pool of workers for requests
      - each request give to a worker
      - a worker will only block its thread if it needs to read from disk
      - while blocking, other requests can come in and be served by other workers

*** CPU Scheduling
    Goal is increased performance (efficiency, throughput)
    Using a scheduler / dispatcher
**** Process characteristics
     - Alternating CPU I/O bursts
     - Many short CPU bursts
     - One process has many bursts
**** Performance Metrics
     - CPU utilization: % time cpu busy with user process, 40-80%
     - Throughput: # processes in the unit time
     - Turnaround time: Time for a job to complete.
       Process completion time - process start time
     - Waiting time: time process spends in ready Queue
       turn around time - cpu burst time
