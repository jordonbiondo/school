** Questions
*** 4.2
     1. During system calls, user level thread will block an entire process while a kernel level thread will not.
     2. Kernel level threads can make better use of multiple CPUs unlike strictly user level threads which the scheduler would not know what to do with exactly.
     3. Any time a program will be making lot's of syscalls, a kernel level thread will be a better choice due to it not blocking.
*** 4.10
    - Global Variabls
    - Heap Memory
** Practical
   - The function assigns a thread to a certain cpu, part of the implementation is to ensure that the thread was properly scheduled and is inactive before the assignment.
   - This function would surely be called during the initilization of the operating system when standard kernel threads are being created and assigned to the CPUs.
